# 🎧 Audio Emotion Classification using XGBoost

This project implements a complete pipeline for classifying emotions from speech using machine learning. It includes a fully functional *Streamlit web app* that allows users to upload ⁠ .wav ⁠ audio files and get real-time emotion predictions using a pre-trained *XGBoost* model.

## 🚀 Features

•⁠  ⁠Upload a ⁠ .wav ⁠ file through the web interface
•⁠  ⁠Extracts MFCC, Chroma, and Mel Spectrogram features
•⁠  ⁠Predicts emotion using a trained ⁠ XGBoost ⁠ model
•⁠  ⁠Displays the predicted emotion in a clean UI
•⁠  ⁠Lightweight and fast — suitable for real-time demos

## 🎯 Emotions Recognized

The model classifies speech into the following 8 emotions:

•⁠  ⁠😠 Angry  
•⁠  ⁠😌 Calm  
•⁠  ⁠🤢 Disgust  
•⁠  ⁠😨 Fearful  
•⁠  ⁠😄 Happy  
•⁠  ⁠😐 Neutral  
•⁠  ⁠😢 Sad  
•⁠  ⁠😲 Surprise
